                    </p>

                    <h4>2. SERVICE DESCRIPTION</h4>
                    <p>
                        "CarinaBot VPS" is a software-based Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting service.
                        No physical hardware is created or dedicated to your VPS instance. Our Service allows you to create your own VPS
                        instance that hosts and runs the “CarinaBot App”. The VPS instances are hosted on the cloud, and each instance hosts
                        one installation of the “CarinaBot App”. The VPS instances are not designed to host any other software or applications.
                    </p>





                    <h4>3. ACCESS TO THE SERVICE</h4>

                        You can access your VPS instance and user profile by logging into <a href="https://vps.carinabot.com" target="_blank">https://vps.carinabot.com</a> with your registered email address.
                    </p>





                    <h4>4. USAGE OF THE SERVICE</h4>
                    <p>
                        In your VPS instance, you can operate the “CarinaBot App” as described in the "CarinaBot App" Terms of Use at <a href="https://www.carinabot.com/terms-of-use.html" target="_blank">https://www.carinabot.com/terms-of-use.html</a> (hereinafter the "CarinaBot App ToU").
                        You can change API-Key and Secret, pause/unpause the app, check the outputs, add funds to the trading account
                        connected to the "CarinaBot App", change the selection of a trading account
                        (connect the "CarinaBot App" to another trading account), and pay the necessary fees.
                        The VPS instance will keep running even when you log out from the "CarinaBot VPS" service unless you deactivate your VPS instance.
                    </p>
